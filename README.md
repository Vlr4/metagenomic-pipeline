This repository provides pipeline and container configurations for running metagenomic pipelines in isolated environments.

The project is inspired by Liang Chen et al., who developed a pipeline for gut metagenome analysis using Nanopore sequencing (Nature, 2023).

This implementation is an independent effort designed for reproducibility and use on HPC clusters with SLURM.

The original pipeline scripts are publicly available at chen318liang/Gut-Metagenome-Pipeline-Based-on-Nanopore-Sequencing.
